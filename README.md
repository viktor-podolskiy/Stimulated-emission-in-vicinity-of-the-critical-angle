# Stimulated-emission-in-vicinity-of-the-critical-angle
Matlab scripts for analyzing emission and leaky modes within dielectric stack

The set of Matlab scripts generates the data for Appl.Phys.Lett (2021) by J.K. Asane et.al. (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0051901)
The codes were tested on Matlab R2021a and Matlab R2020b

To analyze dependence of the propagation length on gain, run "dispersionScript.m"; the script produces datafile "modes.h=2um.mat"
To analyze angular dependence of emission, run "emissionScript.m"; the script produces datafile "emission.h=2um.mat"

Package includes test datafiles that can be loaded into matlab for plotting purposes (see last sections of the scripts)
